###Common git Workflows

This [entire post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/about/) describes a novel approach (named *[git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)*) at having discrete git branches for the different types of development work/stages â€“ making the entire process safer and more automated.

- **Create a new feature branch**

	`git checkout -b <feature-branch> develop`
	
- **Incorporating a finished feature on develop**

	```
	git checkout develop  
	git merge --no-ff <feature-branch>
	git branch -d <feature-branch>
	git push origin develop
	```
	
	> The --no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature. Compare:
